# Instagram-User-Analytics
User analysis involves tracking how users engage with a digital product, such as a software application or a mobile app. The insights derived from this analysis can be used by various teams within the business. For example, the marketing team might use these insights to launch a new campaign, the product team might use them to decide on new features to build, and the development team might use them to improve the overall user experience.
In this project, I'll be using SQL and MySQL Workbench as my tool to analyze Instagram user data and answer questions posed by the management team. The insights will help the product manager and the rest of the team make informed decisions about the future direction of the Instagram app.
